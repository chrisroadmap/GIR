    \caption{Numerical solution for $\alpha$ in FaIR v1.0 and v1.3 versus analytic solution in GIR. This highlights the reason for the lowered $r_0$ parameter in GIR compared to FaIR v1.3 \citep{Smith2017} or v1.0 \citep{Millar2016}, as we see that for pre-industrial $\alpha$ values (0.12 in v1.0 or 0.16 in v1.3), the analytic solution requires a lower iIRF$_{100}$ than the numeric. Despite the marginal difference in shape, we do not find GIR has reduced ability in reproducing historical concentration when compared with FaIR v1.0 or v1.3.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{"../../Final_figures/RCP concetration driven residual emissions".pdf}
    \caption{Differences between historical diagnosed emissions in GIR and the RCP database emissions for CH$_4$ and N$_2$O. This displays high similarity to the imposed natural emissions in FaIR v1.3 (Figure 2 from \cite{Smith2017}), demonstrating that CH$_4$ and N$_2$O cycles in GIR and FaIR v1.3 are not systematically different.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{"../../Final_figures/Rigby_tuned_other_gases_plus_RCP".pdf}
    \caption{Best-estimate annual emissions from a more complex atmospheric model inversion \cite{Rigby2014}, GIR inverse emissions and RCP database emissions. Open black circles show inverse emissions from a 12-box model \cite{Cunnold1994}; solid green lines show inverse emissions from GIR with tuned parameters and solid pink lines show emissions from the RCP database. Inset text shows the tuned species lifetime.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{"../../Final_figures/Etminan verification over RCPs".pdf}
    \caption{Comparison of the effective radiative forcings calculated in GIR versus the simple formulae derived from spectral measurements given in \cite{Etminan2016}.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{"../../Final_figures/RF deviation versus Etminan over RCPs".pdf}
    \caption{Corresponding deviations of FaIR v2.0 from \cite{Etminan2016} formulae for the RCPs. These are plotted as \% deviations against gas concentration (so absolute deviations are considerably lower at low concentrations than high concentrations).}
\end{figure}

\section*{RCP simulations}
Since the RCPs themselves are \emph{concentration} pathways, here we focus on the results of running GIR with concentrations from the RCP database, as was done in the GCMs in CMIP5. We include emissions-driven runs in the Supplementary Information, but these are not fully comparable due to the lack of integration between RCP concentrations and emissions as was planned in \cite{Moss2010}. Figure 32 shows diagnosed emissions that are compatible with the RCP concentration series in FaIRv2.0, run with default parameters plus uncertainties as described above. Here we see the large discrepancies between GIR compatible emissions and the RCP database emissions for CH$_4$ and N$_2$O, while FaIRv2.0 diagnosed emissions agree well with bottom-up emission estimates to the present-day as expected, since GIR is tuned against a very similar historical concentration series.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{"../../Final_figures/RCP concentration driven emissions".pdf}
    \caption{Diagnosed emissions corresponding to the RCPs. Solid lines show best-estimate GIR diagnosed inverse emissions, with associated 5-95\% plumes. Dotted lines show emissions directly from the RCP database. Unfilled black circles show bottom-up emission estimates from GCP and PRIMAP-histTP \citep{Quere2018,Gutschow2016}, smoothed with a 5-yearly running mean.}
\end{figure}
Figure 3 shows the corresponding radiative forcings compared to those from the RCP database. The updated simple RF formulae described in \cite{Etminan2016} increase the RF of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$, while marginally decreasing the N$_2$O RF.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{"../../Final_figures/RCP concentration driven RF".pdf}
    \caption{Radiative forcing as computed from the RCP database concentrations using GIR, and corresponding forcings diagnosed by MAGICC from the database.}
\end{figure}
Figure 4 shows historical and future global mean surface temperature ranges (GMST) under the RCP scenarios diagnosed by GIR, alongside historical observed data and future projections from CMIP5. We see that the GIR diagnosed temperatures closely resemble the observed GMST series, but are lower than the CMIP5 ranges. This is due to the default climate response parameter selection in GIR as described above and is discussed in \cite{Richardson2016}.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{"../../Final_figures/RCP concentration driven temperatures".pdf}
    \caption{RCP temperature anomalies computed by GIR, and ranges from the CMIP5 ensemble. Solid lines and plumes show best-estimate and 5-95\% range temperature anomaly simulated in GIR. Unfilled black circles show observed GMST as the mean of 4 temperature datasets \citep{Vose2012,Cowtan2014,Lenssen2019,Morice2011}, smoothed with a 5-yearly running mean. Error bars in 2090 show CMIP5 projected 2081:2100 mean temperature anomalies \citep{Collins2013}.}

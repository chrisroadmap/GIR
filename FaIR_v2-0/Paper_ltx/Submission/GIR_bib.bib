abstract = {The profound changes in global SO2 emissions over the last decades have affected atmospheric composition on a regional and global scale with large impact on air quality, atmospheric deposition and the radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols. Reproduction of historical atmospheric pollution levels based on global aerosol models and emission changes is crucial to prove that such models are able to predict future scenarios. Here, we analyze consistency of trends in observations of sulfur components in air and precipitation from major regional networks and estimates from six different global aerosol models from 1990 until 2015. There are large interregional differences in the sulfur trends consistently captured by the models and observations, especially for North America and Europe. Europe had the largest reductions in sulfur emissions in the first part of the period while the highest reduction came later in North America and East Asia. The uncertainties in both the emissions and the representativity of the observations are larger in Asia. However, emissions from East Asia clearly increased from 2000 to 2005 followed by a decrease, while in India a steady increase over the whole period has been observed and modelled. The agreement between a bottom-up approach, which uses emissions and process-based chemical transport models, with independent observations gives an improved confidence in the understanding of the atmospheric sulfur budget.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Global efforts to mitigate climate change are guided by projections of future temperatures. But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain, complicating the setting of stabilization targets to avoid potentially dangerous levels of global warming. Similar problems apply to the carbon cycle: observations currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emissions. Here we use ensemble simulations of simple climate-carbon-cycle models constrained by observations and projections from more comprehensive models to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathways. We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario. Furthermore, the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (timing of emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets. Total anthropogenic emissions of one trillion tonnes of carbon (3.67 trillion tonnes of CO 2), about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began, results in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, with a 5-95{\%} confidence interval of 1.3-3.9°C. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {While cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions dominate anthropogenic warming over centuries, temperatures over the coming decades are also strongly affected by short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), complicating the estimation of cumulative emission budgets for ambitious mitigation goals. Using conventional Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) to convert SLCPs to “CO2-equivalent” emissions misrepresents their impact on global temperature. Here we show that peak warming under a range of mitigation scenarios is determined by a linear combination of cumulative CO2 emissions to the time of peak warming and non-CO2 radiative forcing immediately prior to that time. This may be understood by expressing aggregate non-CO2 forcing as cumulative CO2 forcing-equivalent (CO2-fe) emissions. We show further that contributions to CO2-fe emissions are well approximated by a new usage of GWP, denoted GWP*, which relates cumulative CO2 emissions to date with the current rate of emission of SLCPs. GWP* accurately indicates the impact of emissions of both long-lived and short-lived pollutants on radiative forcing and temperatures over a wide range of timescales, including under ambitious mitigation when conventional GWPs fail. Measured by GWP*, implementing the Paris Agreement would reduce the expected rate of warming in 2030 by 28{\%} relative to a No Policy scenario. Expressing mitigation efforts in terms of their impact on future cumulative emissions aggregated using GWP* would relate them directly to contributions to future warming, better informing both burden-sharing discussions and long-term policies and measures in pursuit of ambitious global temperature goals.},

abstract = {Natural methane emissions from wetlands and fire, and soil uptake of methane, simulated using the Cana-dian Land Surface Scheme and Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem (CLASS-CTEM) modelling framework, over the historical 1850-2008 period, are assessed by using a one-box model of atmospheric methane burden. This one-box model also requires anthropogenic emissions and the methane sink in the atmosphere to simulate the historical evolution of global methane burden. For this purpose, global an-thropogenic methane emissions for the period 1850-2008 were reconstructed based on the harmonized representative concentration pathway (RCP) and Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) data sets. The methane sink in the atmosphere is represented using bias-corrected methane lifetimes from the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM). The resulting evolution of atmospheric methane concentration over the historical period compares reasonably well with observation-based estimates (correlation = 0.99, root mean square error = 35 ppb). The modelled natural emissions are also assessed using an inverse procedure where the methane lifetimes required to reproduce the observed year-to-year increase in atmospheric methane burden are calculated based upon the specified global anthropogenic and modelled natural emissions that we have used here. These calculated methane lifetimes over the historical period fall within the uncertainty range of observation-based estimates. The present-day (2000-2008) values of modelled methane emissions from wetlands (169 Tg CH 4 yr −1) and fire (27 Tg CH 4 yr −1), methane uptake by soil (29 Tg CH 4 yr −1), and the budget terms associated with overall anthropogenic and natural emissions are consistent with estimates reported in a recent global methane budget that is based on top-down approaches constrained by observed atmospheric methane burden. The modelled wetland emissions increase over the historical period in response to both increases in precipitation and in atmospheric CO 2 concentration. This increase in wetland emissions over the historical period yields evolution of the atmospheric methane concentration that compares better with observation-based values than the case when wetland emissions are held constant over the historical period.},

abstract = {The European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) provides an aerosol re-analysis starting from year 2003 for the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project. The re-analysis assimilates total aerosol optical depth retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to correct for model departures from observed aerosols. The re-analysis therefore combines satellite retrievals with the full spatial coverage of a numerical model. Re-analysed products are used here to estimate the shortwave direct and first indirect radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols over the period 2003-2010, using methods previously applied to satellite retrievals of aerosols and clouds. The best estimate of globally-averaged, all-sky direct radiative forcing is −0.7 ± 0.3 Wm −2. The standard deviation is obtained by a Monte-Carlo analysis of uncertainties, which accounts for uncertainties in the aerosol anthropogenic fraction , aerosol absorption, and cloudy-sky effects. Further accounting for differences between the present-day natural and pre-industrial aerosols provides a direct radiative forcing estimate of −0.4 ± 0.3 Wm −2. The best estimate of globally-averaged, all-sky first indirect radiative forcing is −0.6 ± 0.4 Wm −2. Its standard deviation accounts for uncertainties in the aerosol anthropogenic fraction, and in cloud albedo and cloud droplet number concentration susceptibil-ities to aerosol changes. The distribution of first indirect ra-diative forcing is asymmetric and is bounded by −0.1 and −2.0 Wm −2. In order to decrease uncertainty ranges, better observational constraints on aerosol absorption and sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentrations to aerosol changes are required.},

abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, and its atmospheric concentration has nearly tripled since pre-industrial times. The growth rate of atmospheric methane is determined by the balance between surface emissions and photochemical destruction by the hydroxyl radical, the major atmospheric oxidant. Remarkably, this growth rate has decreased markedly since the early 1990s, and the level of methane has remained relatively constant since 1999, leading to a downward revision of its projected influence on global temperatures. Large fluctuations in the growth rate of atmospheric methane are also observed from one year to the next, but their causes remain uncertain. Here we quantify the processes that controlled variations in methane emissions between 1984 and 2003 using an inversion model of atmospheric transport and chemistry. Our results indicate that wetland emissions dominated the inter-annual variability of methane sources, whereas fire emissions played a smaller role, except during the 1997-1998 El Nĩo event. These top-down estimates of changes in wetland and fire emissions are in good agreement with independent estimates based on remote sensing information and biogeochemical models. On longer timescales, our results show that the decrease in atmospheric methane growth during the 1990s was caused by a decline in anthropogenic emissions. Since 1999, however, they indicate that anthropogenic emissions of methane have risen again. The effect of this increase on the growth rate of atmospheric methane has been masked by a coincident decrease in wetland emissions, but atmospheric methane levels may increase in the near future if wetland emissions return to their mean 1990s levels. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

The framework includes nonrenewable natural resources which cause greenhouse gas emissions; pollution stock harms capital and reduces economic growth. We find a big effect of the selected damage function on the social cost of carbon and a significant impact on the growth rate. In our calibration a quartic damage function raises the social cost of carbon by more than a factor of ten compared to the linear function. In the social optimum the growth rate remains positive even when the damage function is highly convex. We test the robustness of the results by adding pollution decay and lowering the elasticity of intertemporal substitution which does not alter our results. We find that high marginal climate damages require stringent climate policies but do not preclude positive economic growth despite convexity, provided that policies are designed in an efficient manner.},

abstract = {The relationship between forcing and emission is investigated for black carbon (BC) and primary organic carbon (OC) emitted from North America and Asia. Direct and indirect radiative forcing (DRF and IRF) of BC and OC are simulated with CAM5.1. Two diagnostics are introduced to aid policy-relevant discussions: linearity and emission-normalized forcing. DRF is linearly related to emission for both BC and OC from two regions, and the linear relationship is similar, within 15{\%}. IRF is linear in emissions when emissions are lower and regions are far from sources (North American BC and OC). Indirect radiative forcing is sublinear for strong sources and near-source regions (Asian OC). Emission-normalized IRF in North America is two to four times higher than that in Asia. The difference among regions and species is primarily caused by particle density as high density of BC results in fewer emitted particles and by the processes for accumulation mode particles to become cloud condensation nuclei and then to activate into cloud droplet. Lower emission-normalized IRF in more polluted regions means that reductions of OC in these regions would be relatively climate-neutral rather than causing significant warming via IRF reduction. An optimal aggregation area (30° × 30°) is identified for analysis of the forcing-to-emission relationship. For IRF, only 15–40{\%} of the Earth's surface is significantly affected by an emission region, but forcing in these regions comprises most of the global impact. Emission-normalized forcing can be used to estimate forcing changes due to emission reductions, as long as causes of nonlinearity are identified and considered.},

abstract = {Thirteen years of Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment/Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment CCl3F and CCl2F2 measurements at five remote, surface, globally distributed sites are analyzed. Comparisons are made against shipboard measurements by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography group and archived air samples collected at Cape Grim, Tasmania, since 1978. CCl3F in the lower troposphere was increasing at an average rate of 9.2 ppt/yr over the period July 1978 to June 1988. CCl2F2 was increasing at an average 17.3 ppt/yr in the lower troposphere over the same period. However, between July 1988 and June 1991 the increases of CCl3F and CCl2F2 in this region have averaged just 7.0 ppt/yr and 15.7 ppt/yr, respectively. The rate of increase has been decreasing 2.4 ppt/yr2 and 2.9 ppt/yr2 over this 3-year period. Based on a recent scenario of the global releases of these compounds and using the new calibration scale SIO 1993, the equilibrium lifetimes are estimated to be 44 - 10 + 17 and 180 - 81 + 820 years for CCl3F and CCl2F2, respectively. Using these lifetime estimates and a two-dimensional model, it is estimated that global releases of these two chlorofluorocarbons in 1990 were 249 ± 28 × 106 kg for CCl3F and 366 ± 30 × 106 kg for CCl2F2. It is also estimated that combined releases of these chlorofluorocarbons in 1990 were 21 ± 5{\%} less than those in 1986.},

Global OH is estimated to increase, in average by 0.08{\%} per year, with exception of 1997 and 1998 when deviations from the trend result from unusually large biomass burning emissions. The global OH evolution is highly dependent on the CO to NOx emission ratio, and a statistically significant linear relation between this ratio and the OH concentration is found. However, we find large regional variations of OH distributions and methane loss. One third of a calculated increase in global average methane loss (0.50{\%} per year) can be explained by OH changes resulting from emission changes of CO, NOx and NMVOCs, while two third is due to increases in methane itself.},

Here we update estimates and their uncertainties for current anthropogenic and natural N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions and for emissions scenarios to 2050. Although major uncertainties remain, 'bottom-up' inventories and 'top-down' atmospheric modeling yield estimates that are in broad agreement. Global natural N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions are most likely between 10 and 12 Tg N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O-N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Net anthropogenic N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions are now about 5.3 Tg N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O-N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Gross anthropogenic emissions by sector are 66{\%} from agriculture, 15{\%} from energy and transport sectors, 11{\%} from biomass burning, and 8{\%} from other sources. A decrease in natural emissions from tropical soils due to deforestation reduces gross anthropogenic emissions by about 14{\%}. Business-as-usual emission scenarios project almost a doubling of anthropogenic N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions by 2050. In contrast, concerted mitigation scenarios project an average decline of 22{\%} relative to 2005, which would lead to a near stabilization of atmospheric concentration of N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O at about 350 ppb. The impact of growing demand for biofuels on future projections of N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions is highly uncertain; N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions from second and third generation biofuels could remain trivial or could become the most significant source to date. It will not be possible to completely eliminate anthropogenic N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions from agriculture, but better matching of crop N needs and N supply offers significant opportunities for emission reductions.},

During 2007, CH4 increased by 8.3 ± 0.6 ppb. CH4 mole fractions averaged over polar northern latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere increased more than other zonally averaged regions. In 2008, globally averaged CH4 increased by 4.4 ± 0.6 ppb; the largest increase was in the tropics, while polar northern latitudes did not increase. Satellite and in situ CO observations suggest only a minor contribution to increased CH4 from biomass burning. The most likely drivers of the CH4 anomalies observed during 2007 and 2008 are anomalously high temperatures in the Arctic and greater than average precipitation in the tropics. Near-zero CH4 growth in the Arctic during 2008 suggests we have not yet activated strong climate feedbacks from permafrost and CH4 hydrates.},

abstract = {By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima experiments) and the CMIP Historical Simulation (1850–near-present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP, (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble, and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and the CMIP Historical Simulation to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP Historical Simulation, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. The participation in the CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs will be at the discretion of the modelling groups, and will depend on scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: (i) how does the Earth system respond to forcing?, (ii) what are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?, and (iii) how can we assess future climate changes given climate variability, predictability and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and the CMIP6 Historical Simulation, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

abstract = {Most emission metrics have previously been inconsistently estimated by including the climate-carbon feedback for the reference gas (i.e. CO 2) but not the other species (e.g. CH 4). In the fifth assessment report of the IPCC, a first attempt was made to consistently account for the climate-carbon feedback in emission metrics. This attempt was based on only one study, and therefore the IPCC concluded that more research was needed. Here, we carry out this research. First, using the simple Earth system model OSCAR v2.2, we establish a new impulse response function for the climate-carbon feedback. Second, we use this impulse response function to provide new estimates for the two most common metrics: global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature-change potential (GTP). We find that, when the climate-carbon feedback is correctly accounted for, the emission metrics of non-CO 2 species increase, but in most cases not as much as initially indicated by IPCC. We also find that, when the feedback is removed for both the reference and studied species, these relative metric values only have modest changes compared to when the feedback is included (absolute metrics change more markedly). Including or excluding the climate-carbon feedback ultimately depends on the user's goal, but consistency should be ensured in either case.},

Taking into account such an efficacy factor is shown to amount to representing the effect of deep-ocean heat uptake on the local strength of the radiative feedback in the transient regime. It involves an additional term in the formulation of the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), which explains the nonlinearity between radiative imbalance and the mean surface temperature observed in some AOGCMs. An analytical solution of this system is given and this simple linear EBM is calibrated for the set of 16 AOGCMs of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) studied in Part I.

Integrated assessment model results for 14 different emissions species and 13 emissions sectors are provided for each scenario with consistent transitions from the historical data used in CMIP6 to future trajectories using automated harmonization before being downscaled to provide higher emissions source spatial detail. We find that the scenarios span a wide range of end-of-century radiative forcing values, thus making this set of scenarios ideal for exploring a variety of warming pathways. The set of scenarios is bounded on the low end by a 1.9 W m −2 scenario, ideal for analyzing a world with end-of-century temperatures well below 2 • C, and on the high end by a 8.5 W m −2 scenario, resulting in an increase in warming of nearly 5 • C over pre-industrial levels. Between these two extremes, scenarios are provided such that differences between forcing outcomes provide statistically significant regional temperature outcomes to maximize their usefulness for downstream experiments within CMIP6.

Using newly available simulations and a new observational temperature dataset to 2010, TCRE is estimated from observations by dividing an observationally constrained estimate of CO2-attributable warming by an estimate of cumulative carbon emissions to date, yielding an observationally constrained 5{\%}–95{\%} range of 0.7–2.0 K EgC−1.},

We identify four possible contributory effects. First, the surface climate system loses heat less readily into the ocean beneath as the latter warms. The model spread in the thermal coupling between the upper and deep ocean largely explains the model spread in ocean heat uptake efficiency. Second, CO2 radiative forcing may rise more rapidly than logarithmically with CO2 concentration. Third, the climate feedback parameter may decline as the CO2 concentration rises. With CMIP5 data, we cannot distinguish the second and third possibilities. Fourth, the climate feedback parameter declines as time passes or T rises; in 1pctCO2, this effect is less important than the others. We find t...},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} A hierarchy of models is used to explore the role of the ocean in mediating the response of the climate to a single volcanic eruption and to a series of eruptions by drawing cold temperature anomalies into its interior, as measured by the ocean heat exchange parameter q (W m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} K {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} ). The response to a single (Pinatubo-like) eruption comprises two primary time scales: one fast (year) and one slow (decadal). Over the fast time scale, the ocean sequesters cooling anomalies induced by the eruption into its depth, enhancing the damping rate of sea surface temperature (SST) relative to that which would be expected if the atmosphere acted alone. This compromises the ability to constrain atmospheric feedback rates measured by $\lambda$ ({\~{}}1 W m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} K {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} ) from study of the relaxation of SST back toward equilibrium, but yields information about the transient climate sensitivity proportional to $\lambda$ + q. Our study suggests that q can significantly exceed $\lambda$ in the immediate aftermath of an eruption. Shielded from damping to the atmosphere, the effect of the volcanic eruption persists on longer decadal time scales. We contrast the response to an “impulse” from that of a “step” in which the forcing is kept constant in time. Finally, we assess the “accumulation potential” of a succession of volcanic eruptions over time, a process that may in part explain the prolongation of cold surface temperatures experienced during, for example, the Little Ice Age. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We combine several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of emissions pathways for each country and Kyoto gas, covering the years 1850 to 2014 with yearly values, for all UNFCCC member states and most non-UNFCCC territories. The sectoral resolution is that of the main IPCC 1996 categories. Additional time series of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} are available for energy and industry subsectors. Country-resolved data are combined from different sources and supplemented using year-to-year growth rates from regionally resolved sources and numerical extrapolations to complete the dataset. Regional deforestation emissions are downscaled to country level using estimates of the deforested area obtained from potential vegetation and simulations of agricultural land. In this paper, we discuss the data sources and methods used and present the resulting dataset, including its limitations and uncertainties.

abstract = {[1] In the mid-1970s, it was recognized that chlorofluorocar-bons (CFCs) were strong greenhouse gases that could have substantial impacts on radiative forcing of climate change, as well as being substances that deplete stratospheric ozone. Around a decade later, this group of radiatively active compounds was expanded to include a large number of replacements for ozone-depleting substances such as chlorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), bromofluorocarbons, and bromochlorofluorocarbons. This paper systematically reviews the published literature concerning the radiative efficiencies (REs) of CFCs, bromofluorocarbons and bromochlorofluorocarbons (halons), HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, sulfur hexafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, and related halogen containing compounds. In addition, we provide a comprehensive and self-consistent set of new calculations of REs and global warming potentials (GWPs) for these compounds, mostly employing atmospheric lifetimes taken from the available literature. We also present global temperature change potentials for selected gases. Infrared absorption spectra used in the RE calculations were taken from databases and individual studies and from experimental and ab initio computational studies. Evaluations of REs and GWPs are presented for more than 200 compounds. Our calculations yield REs significantly ({\textgreater} 5{\%}) different from those in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for 49 compounds. We present new RE values for more than 100 gases which were not included in AR4. A widely used simple method to calculate REs and GWPs from absorption spectra and atmospheric lifetimes is assessed and updated. This is the most comprehensive review of the radiative efficiencies and global warming potentials of halogenated compounds performed to date.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of future methane abundances following a climate scenario requires understanding the lifetime changes driven by anthropogenic emissions, meteorological factors, and chemistry-climate feedbacks. Uncertainty in any of these influences or the underlying processes implies uncertainty in future abundance and radiative forcing. We simulate methane lifetime in three chemical transport models (CTMs)-UCI CTM, GEOS-Chem, and Oslo CTM3-over the period 1997-2009 and compare the mod-els' year-to-year variability against constraints from global methyl chloroform observations. Using sensitivity tests, we find that temperature, water vapor, stratospheric ozone column , biomass burning and lightning NO x are the dominant sources of interannual changes in methane lifetime in all three models. We also evaluate each model's response to forcings that have impacts on decadal time scales, such as methane feedback, and anthropogenic emissions. In general, these different CTMs show similar sensitivities to the driving variables. We construct a parametric model that reproduces most of the interannual variability of each CTM and use it to predict methane lifetime from 1980 through 2100 following a specified emissions and climate scenario (RCP 8.5). The parametric model propagates uncertainties through all steps and provides a foundation for predicting methane abundances in any climate scenario. Our sensitivity tests also enable a new estimate of the methane global warming potential (GWP), accounting for stratospheric ozone effects, including those mediated by water vapor. We estimate the 100-yr GWP to be 32, which is 25 {\%} larger than past assessments.},

abstract = {The atmospheric methane (CH 4) chemical feedback is a key process for understanding the behavior of atmospheric CH 4 and its environmental impact. This work reviews how the feedback is defined and used, then examines the meteorological, chemical, and emission factors that control the feedback strength. Geographical and temporal variations in the feedback are described and explained by HO x (HO x 5 OH 1 HO 2) production and partitioning. Different CH 4 boundary conditions used by models, however , make no meaningful difference to the feedback calculation. The strength of the CH 4 feedback depends on atmospheric composition, particularly the atmospheric CH 4 burden, and is therefore not constant. Sensitivity tests show that the feedback depends very weakly on temperature, insolation, water vapor, and emissions of NO. While the feedback strength has likely remained within 10{\%} of its present value over the industrial era and likely will over the twenty-first century, neglecting these changes biases our understanding of CH 4 impacts. Most environmental consequences per kg of CH 4 emissions, including its global warming potential (GWP), scale with the perturbation time, which may have grown as much as 40{\%} over the industrial era and continues to rise. Plain Language Summary Methane emissions alter atmospheric chemistry in ways that amplify the impact of those emissions. This work examines the chemical and meteorological causes of that feedback. The feedback and environmental impacts of CH 4 emissions have likely strengthened over the historical era.},

abstract = {Previous attempts to quantify the global source strength of CH4 from natural wetlands have resulted in a range of 90-260 Tg(CH4) yr -•. This relatively uncertain estimate significantly limits our understanding of atmospheric methane. In this study we reduce this uncertainty by simulating preindustrial CH4 with a three-dimensional chemistry-transport model. Methane mixing ratios and •13C-CH4, as deduced from ice cores, and estimates of other preindustrial sources and sinks, are used as constraints. This yields an average preindustrial natural wetland source strength of 163 Tg(CH4) yr -1, with an estimated 4-20 uncertainty range of 130-194 Tg(CH4)yr -• . The present natural wetland source may be • 10{\%} smaller, owing to drainage and cultivation of wetland area since 1800 A.D. The simulated pole-to-pole concentration difference is found to be rather insensitive to the assumed relative contributions of important preindustrial sources and sinks, and therefore imposes only a limited constraint on the estimate of natural wetland emissions. In contrast, •13C-CH4 could provide robust constraints, but, unfortunately, at present reliable measurements are absent. Estimates of the historic development of anthropogenic CH4 sources, in combination with our model calculations, can largely explain the increase of methane mixing ratios during the nineteenth century. Results for the twentieth century indicate that these historical emission inventories underestimate anthropogenic emissions by at least 10{\%}. Simulations of preindustrial and present-day isotopic ratios show that the growth of anthropogenic sources since 1800 A.D. may have increased d13C-CH4 by 3{\%}},

abstract = {Abstract The relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and CO2?induced warming is determined by the Transient Climate Response to Emissions (TCRE), but total anthropogenic warming also depends on non?CO2 forcing, complicating the interpretation of emissions budgets based on CO2 alone. An alternative is to frame emissions budgets in terms of CO2?forcing?equivalent (CO2?fe) emissions?the CO2 emissions that would yield a given total anthropogenic radiative forcing pathway. Unlike conventional ?CO2?equivalent? emissions, these are directly related to warming by the TCRE and need to fall to zero to stabilize warming: hence, CO2?fe emissions generalize the concept of a cumulative carbon budget to multigas scenarios. Cumulative CO2?fe emissions from 1870 to 2015 inclusive are found to be 2,900 ± 600 GtCO2?fe, increasing at a rate of 67 ± 9.5 GtCO2?fe/yr. A TCRE range of 0.8?2.5°C per 1,000 GtC implies a total budget for 0.6°C of additional warming above the present decade of 880?2,750 GtCO2?fe, with 1,290 GtCO2?fe implied by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 median response, corresponding to 19 years' CO2?fe emissions at the current rate.},

We found that the pre-industrial concentration of nitrous oxide remained constant over the period we studied and that the average atmospheric concentration was 285 ± I ppb volume (90{\%} confidence limits), representing about 2100 Tg (2100 x 10 12 g) of N 2 0 in the atmosphere, whereas the average concentration in 1984 was about 307 ppb volume or 2260 Tg. This is a change of 22 ppb volume (160 Tg), or about 8{\%}, between pre-industrial and present times. Now the rate of change is between 0.7 and 0.9 ppb volume/ year or 5 and 6.5 Tg/year, which is a slow increase of about 0.3{\%} per year. The changes observed are probably caused by increasing use of fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil, and perhaps to a lesser extent by the use of nitrogen fertilizers in recent years. The atmospheric lifetime of N 2 0 is probably between 100 and ISO years. The pre-industrial concentrations, present levels, and a lifetime of 100 years are consistent with natural sources, mostly soils and oceans, of about 22 Tg / year and the present anthropogenic sources of about 8.7 Tg/year.

abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, responsible for about 20{\%} of the warming induced by long-lived greenhouse gases since pre-industrial times. By reacting with hydroxyl radicals, methane reduces the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and generates ozone in the troposphere. Although most sources and sinks of methane have been identified, their relative contributions to atmospheric methane levels are highly uncertain. As such, the factors responsible for the observed stabilization of atmospheric methane levels in the early 2000s, and the renewed rise after 2006, remain unclear. Here, we construct decadal budgets for methane sources and sinks between 1980 and 2010, using a combination of atmospheric measurements and results from chemical transport models, ecosystem models, climate chemistry models and inventories of anthropogenic emissions. The resultant budgets suggest that data-driven approaches and ecosystem models overestimate total natural emissions. We build three contrasting emission scenarios [mdash] which differ in fossil fuel and microbial emissions [mdash] to explain the decadal variability in atmospheric methane levels detected, here and in previous studies, since 1985. Although uncertainties in emission trends do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn, we show that the observed stabilization of methane levels between 1999 and 2006 can potentially be explained by decreasing-to-stable fossil fuel emissions, combined with stable-to-increasing microbial emissions. We show that a rise in natural wetland emissions and fossil fuel emissions probably accounts for the renewed increase in global methane levels after 2006, although the relative contribution of these two sources remains uncertain.},

Here we show that, for simple geometrical reasons, the combination of both the level and rate of human-induced warming provides a remarkably accurate prediction of remaining emission budgets to peak warming across a broad range of scenarios, if budgets are expressed in terms of CO2-forcing-equivalent emissions. These in turn predict CO2 emissions budgets if (but only if) the fractional contribution of non-CO2 drivers to warming remains approximately unchanged, as it does in some ambitious mitigation scenarios, indicating a best-estimate remaining budget for 1.5 °C of about 22 years' current emissions from mid-2017, with a ‘likely' (1 standard error) range of 13–32 years. This provides a simple, transparent and model-independent metric of progress towards an ambitious temperature stabilization goal that could be used to inform the Paris Agreement stocktake process. It is less applicable to less ambitious goals. Alternative definitions of current warming and scenarios for non-CO2 drivers give lower 1.5 °C budgets. Lower budgets based on the MAGICC simple modelling system widely used in integrated assessment studies reflect its relatively high simulated current warming rates.},

abstract = {An accurate estimate of global hydroxyl radical (OH) abundance is important for projections of air quality, climate, and stratospheric ozone recovery. As the atmospheric mixing ratios of methyl chloroform (CH 3 CCl 3) (MCF), the commonly used OH reference gas, approaches zero, it is important to find alternative approaches to infer atmospheric OH abundance and variability. The lack of global bottom-up emission inventories is the primary obstacle in choosing a MCF alternative. We illustrate that global emissions of long-lived trace gases can be inferred from their observed mixing ratio differences between the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH), given realistic estimates of their NH-SH exchange time, the emission partitioning between the two hemispheres, and the NH versus SH OH abundance ratio. Using the observed long-term trend and emissions derived from the measured hemispheric gradient, the combination of HFC-32 (CH 2 F 2), HFC-134a (CH 2 FCF 3 , HFC-152a (CH 3 CHF 2), and HCFC-22 (CHClF 2), instead of a single gas, will be useful as a MCF alternative to infer global and hemispheric OH abundance and trace gas lifetimes. The primary assumption on which this multispecies approach relies is that the OH lifetimes can be estimated by scaling the thermal reaction rates of a reference gas at 272 K on global and hemispheric scales. Thus, the derived hemispheric and global OH estimates are forced to reconcile the observed trends and gradient for all four compounds simultaneously. However, currently, observations of these gases from the surface networks do not provide more accurate OH abundance estimate than that from MCF.},

abstract = {More than 100 countries have adopted a global warming limit of 2 degrees C or below (relative to pre-industrial levels) as a guiding principle for mitigation efforts to reduce climate change risks, impacts and damages. However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponding to a specified maximum warming are poorly known owing to uncertainties in the carbon cycle and the climate response. Here we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying GHG emission budgets for the 2000-50 period that would limit warming throughout the twenty-first century to below 2 degrees C, based on a combination of published distributions of climate system properties and observational constraints. We show that, for the chosen class of emission scenarios, both cumulative emissions up to 2050 and emission levels in 2050 are robust indicators of the probability that twenty-first century warming will not exceed 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Limiting cumulative CO(2) emissions over 2000-50 to 1,000 Gt CO(2) yields a 25{\%} probability of warming exceeding 2 degrees C-and a limit of 1,440 Gt CO(2) yields a 50{\%} probability-given a representative estimate of the distribution of climate system properties. As known 2000-06 CO(2) emissions were approximately 234 Gt CO(2), less than half the proven economically recoverable oil, gas and coal reserves can still be emitted up to 2050 to achieve such a goal. Recent G8 Communiqu{\'{e}}s envisage halved global GHG emissions by 2050, for which we estimate a 12-45{\%} probability of exceeding 2 degrees C-assuming 1990 as emission base year and a range of published climate sensitivity distributions. Emissions levels in 2020 are a less robust indicator, but for the scenarios considered, the probability of exceeding 2 degrees C rises to 53-87{\%} if global GHG emissions are still more than 25{\%} above 2000 levels in 2020.},

Those elevated GHG concentrations warm the planet and – partially offset by net cooling effects by aerosols – are largely responsible for the observed warming over the past 150 years. An accurate representation of GHG concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent climate change. So far, community efforts to create composite datasets of GHG concentrations with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary layer conditions and recent trends since the 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated datasets of historical atmospheric concentrations (mole fractions) of 43 GHGs to be used in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project – Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments. The presented datasets are based on AGAGE and NOAA networks, firn and ice core data, and archived air data, and a large set of published studies. In contrast to previous intercomparisons, the new datasets are latitudinally resolved and include seasonality. We focus on the period 1850–2014 for historical CMIP6 runs, but data are also provided for the last 2000 years. We provide consolidated datasets in various spatiotemporal resolutions for carbon dioxide (CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), methane (CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) and nitrous oxide (N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O), as well as 40 other GHGs, namely 17 ozone-depleting substances, 11 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 9 perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF{\textless}sub{\textgreater}6{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), nitrogen trifluoride (NF{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}). In addition, we provide three equivalence species that aggregate concentrations of GHGs other than CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O, weighted by their radiative forcing efficiencies.

abstract = {Abstract. Projections of the response to anthropogenic emission scenarios, evaluation of some greenhouse gas metrics, and estimates of the social cost of carbon often require a simple model that links emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to atmospheric concentrations and global temperature changes. An essential requirement of such a model is to reproduce typical global surface temperature and atmospheric CO2 responses displayed by more complex Earth system models (ESMs) under a range of emission scenarios, as well as an ability to sample the range of ESM response in a transparent, accessible and reproducible form. Here we adapt the simple model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) to explicitly represent the state dependence of the CO2 airborne fraction. Our adapted model (FAIR) reproduces the range of behaviour shown in full and intermediate complexity ESMs under several idealised carbon pulse and exponential concentration increase experiments. We find that the inclusion of a linear increase in 100-year integrated airborne fraction with cumulative carbon uptake and global temperature change substantially improves the representation of the response of the climate system to CO2 on a range of timescales and under a range of experimental designs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature. The Montreal Protocol was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by enabling reductions in the abundance of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere 1-3 . The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s 1 . However, CFC-11 still contributes one-quarter of all chlorine reaching the stratosphere, and a timely recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer depends on a sustained decline in CFC-11 concentrations 1 . Here we show that the rate of decline of atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations observed at remote measurement sites was constant from 2002 to 2012, and then slowed by about 50 per cent after 2012. The observed slowdown in the decline of CFC-11 concentration was concurrent with a 50 per cent increase in the mean concentration difference observed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and also with the emergence of strong correlations at the Mauna Loa Observatory between concentrations of CFC-11 and other chemicals associated with anthropogenic emissions. A simple model analysis of our findings suggests an increase in CFC-11 emissions of 13 ± 5 gigagrams per year (25 ± 13 per cent) since 2012, despite reported production being close to zero 4 since 2006. Our three-dimensional model simulations confirm the increase in CFC-11 emissions, but indicate that this increase may have been as much as 50 per cent smaller as a result of changes in stratospheric processes or dynamics. The increase in emission of CFC-11 appears unrelated to past production; this suggests unreported new production, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global CFC production by 2010.},

abstract = {Advances in the science and observation of climate change are providing a clearer understanding of the inherent variability of Earth's climate system and its likely response to human and natural influences. The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community. T o improve understanding of the complex interactions of the climate system, ecosystems, and human activities and conditions , the research community develops and uses scenarios. These scenarios provide plausible descriptions of how the future might unfold in several key areas-socioeconomic, technological and environmental conditions, emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and climate. When applied in climate change research, scenarios help to evaluate uncertainty about human contributions to climate change, the response of the Earth system to human activities, the impacts of a range of future climates, and the implications of different approaches to mitigation (measures to reduce net emissions) and adaptation (actions that facilitate response to new climate conditions). Traditionally, model-based scenarios used in climate change research have been developed using a sequential process focused on a step-by-step and time-consuming delivery of information between separated scientific disciplines. Now, climate change researchers from different disciplines have established a new coordinated parallel process for developing scenarios. This starts with four scenarios of future radi-ative forcings (the change in the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation to the atmosphere caused by changes in atmospheric constituents, such as carbon dioxide). Using this starting point, the parallel process will encourage research that will characterize a broad range of possible future climate conditions, taking into account recent climate observations and new information about climate system processes. Studies will give more attention to evaluating adaptation needs and strategies, exploring mitigation options, and improving understanding of potentially large feedbacks (that is, impacts of climate change such as melting of permafrost or dieback of forests that cause further changes in climate). Central to the new parallel process is the concept that the four radiative forcing pathways can be achieved by a diverse range of socioeconomic and technological development scenarios. Among other issues, the parallel process facilitates exploration of the question 'What are the ways in which the world could develop in order to reach a particular radiative forcing pathway?' An immediate consequence of this new approach will be heightened collaboration between impacts, adaptation and vulnerability research, and climate and integrated assessment modelling (Box 1). This will improve the analysis of complex issues, such as the costs, benefits and risks of different policy choices and climate and socioeconomic futures. The parallel process will reduce the time lags between the creation of emissions scenarios, their use in climate modelling, and the application of the resulting climate scenarios in research on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. This Perspective provides an overview of how scenarios are used in climate change research, and summarizes the new process initiated with 'representative concentration pathways' (RCPs) that will provide a framework for modelling in the next stages of scenario-based research. Additional information can be found in refs 1-4. Alternative futures The use of scenarios originated in military planning and gaming, and in the early 1960s was extended into strategic planning in businesses and other organizations where decision makers wanted to analyse, in a systematic way, the implications of investment and other strategic decisions with long-term consequences 5-8. The goal of working with scenarios is not to predict the future, but to better understand uncertainties in order to reach decisions that are robust under a wide range of possible futures 9 .},

Combined with inverse methods, we found near zero atmospheric abundances from the early 1900s to the early 1960s, after which they rose sharply, reaching 1.66{\&}thinsp;ppt (parts per trillion dry-air mole fraction) in 2017. Global {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions rose from near zero in the 1960s to {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;1.2{\&}thinsp;Gg{\&}thinsp;yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the late 1970s to late 1980s, then declined to {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;0.8{\&}thinsp;Gg{\&}thinsp;yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the mid-1990s to early 2000s, followed by a rise since the early 2000s to {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;2.2{\&}thinsp;Gg{\&}thinsp;yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2017. These emissions are significantly larger than inventory based emission estimates. Estimated emissions from eastern Asia rose from 0.36{\&}thinsp;Gg{\&}thinsp;yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2010 to 0.73{\&}thinsp;Gg{\&}thinsp;yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2016 and 2017, 31{\&}thinsp;{\%} of global emissions, mostly from eastern China. We estimate emissions of 0.14{\&}thinsp;Gg{\&}thinsp;yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} from Northern and Central India in 2016 and find evidence for significant emissions from Russia. In contrast, recent emissions from North Western Europe and Australia are estimated to be small (≤{\&}thinsp;1{\&}thinsp;{\%} each). We conclude that emissions from China, India and Russia are likely related to production of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, “Teflon”) and other fluoropolymers that are based on the pyrolysis of hydrochlorofluorocarbon HCFC-22 (CHClF{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) in which {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is a known by-product. The semiconductor sector, where {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is used, is estimated to be a small source. Without an obvious correlation with population density, incineration of waste containing fluoropolymers is probably a minor source, and we find no evidence of emissions from electrolytic production of aluminum in Australia. While many possible emissive uses of {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} are known, the start of significant emissions may well be related to the advent of commercial PTFE production in 1947. Process controls or abatement to reduce {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} by-product were probably not in place in the early decades, explaining the increase in emissions. With the advent of by-product reporting requirements to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the 1990s, concern about climate change and product stewardship, abatement, and perhaps the collection of {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} by-product for use in the semiconductor industry where it can be easily abated, it is conceivable that emissions in developed countries were stabilized and then reduced, explaining the observed emission reduction in the 1980s and 1990s. Concurrently, production of PTFE in China began to increase rapidly. Without emission reduction requirements, it is plausible that global emissions today are dominated by China and other developing countries, in agreement with our analysis. We predict that {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions will continue to rise and that {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} will become the second most important emitted PFC in terms of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}-equivalent emissions within a year or two. The 2017 radiative forcing of {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (0.52{\&}thinsp;mW{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) is small but emissions of {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and other PFCs, due to their very long atmospheric lifetimes, essentially permanently alter Earth's radiative budget and should be reduced. Significant emissions outside of the investigated regions clearly show that observational capabilities and reporting requirements need to be improved to understand global and country scale emissions of PFCs and other synthetic greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} We have analysed time-slice simulations from 17 global models, participating in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP), to explore changes in present-day (2000) hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration and methane (CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) lifetime relative to preindustrial times (1850) and to 1980. A comparison of modeled and observation-derived methane and methyl chloroform lifetimes suggests that the present-day global multi-model mean OH concentration is overestimated by 5 to 10{\%} but is within the range of uncertainties. The models consistently simulate higher OH concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) compared with the Southern Hemisphere (SH) for the present-day (2000; inter-hemispheric ratios of 1.13 to 1.42), in contrast to observation-based approaches which generally indicate higher OH in the SH although uncertainties are large. Evaluation of simulated carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, the primary sink for OH, against ground-based and satellite observations suggests low biases in the NH that may contribute to the high north–south OH asymmetry in the models. The models vary widely in their regional distribution of present-day OH concentrations (up to 34{\%}). Despite large regional changes, the multi-model global mean (mass-weighted) OH concentration changes little over the past 150 yr, due to concurrent increases in factors that enhance OH (humidity, tropospheric ozone, nitrogen oxide (NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}x{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) emissions, and UV radiation due to decreases in stratospheric ozone), compensated by increases in OH sinks (methane abundance, carbon monoxide and non-methane volatile organic carbon (NMVOC) emissions). The large inter-model diversity in the sign and magnitude of preindustrial to present-day OH changes (ranging from a decrease of 12.7{\%} to an increase of 14.6{\%}) indicate that uncertainty remains in our understanding of the long-term trends in OH and methane lifetime. We show that this diversity is largely explained by the different ratio of the change in global mean tropospheric CO and NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}x{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} burdens ($\Delta$CO/$\Delta$NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}x{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, approximately represents changes in OH sinks versus changes in OH sources) in the models, pointing to a need for better constraints on natural precursor emissions and on the chemical mechanisms in the current generation of chemistry-climate models. For the 1980 to 2000 period, we find that climate warming and a slight increase in mean OH (3.5 ± 2.2{\%}) leads to a 4.3 ± 1.9{\%} decrease in the methane lifetime. Analysing sensitivity simulations performed by 10 models, we find that preindustrial to present-day climate change decreased the methane lifetime by about four months, representing a negative feedback on the climate system. Further, we analysed attribution experiments performed by a subset of models relative to 2000 conditions with only one precursor at a time set to 1860 levels. We find that global mean OH increased by 46.4 ± 12.2{\%} in response to preindustrial to present-day anthropogenic NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}x{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emission increases, and decreased by 17.3 ± 2.3{\%}, 7.6 ± 1.5{\%}, and 3.1 ± 3.0{\%} due to methane burden, and anthropogenic CO, and NMVOC emissions increases, respectively.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {An improved stratospheric water vapour data set has been retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT solar oc-cultation measurements. It is similar to that successfully applied to methane and carbon dioxide. There is now a consistent set of data products for the three constituents covering the altitudes 17-45 km, the latitude range between about 50 and 70 • N, and the period August 2002 to April 2012. The new water vapour concentration profiles agree with collocated results from ACE-FTS and MLS/Aura to within ∼ 5 {\%}. A significant positive linear change in water vapour for the time 2003-2011 is observed at lower stratospheric altitudes with a value of about 0.015 ± 0.008 ppmv year −1 around 17 km. Between 30 and 37 km the changes become significantly negative (about −0.01 ± 0.008 ppmv year −1); all errors are 2$\sigma$ values. The combined analysis of the SCIAMACHY methane and water vapour time series shows the expected anti-correlation between stratospheric methane and water vapour and a clear temporal variation related to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). Above about 20 km most of the additional water vapour is attributed to the oxidation of methane. In addition short-term fluctuations and longer-term variations on a timescale of 5-6 years are observed. The SCIAMACHY data confirm that at lower altitudes the amount of water vapour and methane are transported from the tropics to higher latitudes via the shallow branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation .},

Here we report the first in situ global measurements of these two gases. HFC-143a and HFC-32 are the third and sixth most abundant hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) respectively and they currently make an appreciable contribution to the HFCs in terms of atmospheric radiative forcing (1.7 ± 0.04 and 0.7 ± 0.02 mW m −2 in 2012 respectively). In 2012 the global average mole fraction of HFC-143a was 13.4 ± 0.3 ppt (1$\sigma$) in the lower troposphere and its growth rate was 1.4 ± 0.04 ppt yr −1 ; HFC-32 had a global mean mole fraction of 6.2 ± 0.2 ppt and a growth rate of 1.1 ± 0.04 ppt yr −1 in 2012. The extensive observations presented in this work have been combined with an atmospheric transport model to simulate global atmospheric abundances and derive global emission estimates. It is estimated that 23 ± 3 Gg yr −1 of HFC-143a and 21 ± 11 Gg yr −1 of HFC-32 were emitted globally in 2012, and the emission rates are estimated to be increasing by 7 ± 5 {\%} yr −1 for HFC-143a and 14 ± 11 {\%} yr −1 for HFC-32.},

abstract = {The time scales and mode of the atmosphere's response to chemical perturbations are defined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system. The eigenstates of a simplified one-box CH4-CO-OH system are analyzed. The longest time constant (smallest eigenvalue) always exceeds the lifetime defined by the steady-state loss frequency for CH4, the longest lived gas. Thus, the extent of a CH4 perturbation -- the methane response time -- is always longer than predicted by the steady-state lifetime and is independent of size of the perturbation in the linear limit. This lengthening of the atmospheric recovery time can be diagnosed by how close we are to a chemically unstable troposphere, i.e., how much OH production exceeds that minimum needed to oxidize just the global emissions of CH4, CO, and other hydrocarbons and species.},

abstract = {Methane lies at the nexus of climate and air quality, being both a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas—causing about one-half of the warming of carbon dioxide—and a precursor of tropospheric ozone pollution. Over the industrial era, atmospheric methane abundances rose from about 720 parts per billion (ppb) (10−9 mole fraction) to over 1,850 ppb today. Humans have driven this change largely through agriculture, waste, and fossil fuel emissions. The community's regular review of the science of atmospheric methane via the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports [First Assessment Report (FAR), 1990 (1); Second Assessment Report (SAR), 1995 (2); Third Assessment Report (TAR), 2001 (3); Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 2007 (4); and Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), 2013 (5)] has maintained both a scientific interest and political urgency as nations seek to mitigate near-term climate change and keep the overall warming to less than 2 °C (6⇓⇓–9). The recent history (Fig. 1), based on ref. 10, shows a complex overall growth with different rates and even a pause from 2000 to 2006. The many conflicting reports of this recent variability (11⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–23) suggest that it remains unexplained, or perhaps overexplained. Past work has separately used measurements of methane, its isotopes, and related gases to interpret the methane history. Two new publications (24, 25) combine these complementary data into a consistent Bayesian modeling framework and use advanced statistical methods to match all observations simultaneously subject to the prior constraints. Notably, they advance our understanding of what could have caused the variability. The similarities and differences of optimal solutions that emerge from both studies teach us about the information contained in present observations, as well as their limits.},

We present a method for estimating the fraction of greenhouse gases attributable to human activities, both currently and for future scenarios. Key variables used to calculate the atmospheric chemistry and budgets of major non-CO2greenhouse gases are codified along with their uncertainties, and then used to project budgets and abundances under the new climate-change scenarios. This new approach uses our knowledge of changing abundances and lifetimes to estimate current total anthropogenic emissions, independently and possibly more accurately than inventory-based scenarios. We derive a present-day atmospheric lifetime for methane (CH4) of 9.1 ± 0.9 y and anthropogenic emissions of 352 ± 45 Tg/y (64{\%} of total emissions). For N2O, corresponding values are 131 ± 10 y and 6.5 ± 1.3 TgN/y (41{\%} of total); and for HFC-134a, the lifetime is 14.2 ± 1.5 y.},

They are the following: (1) to accurately measure the temporal and spatial distributions of anthropogenic gases that contribute the majority of reactive halogen to the stratosphere and/or are strong infrared absorbers (chlorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons - CFCs, bromocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons - HCFCs, hydrofluorocarbons - HFCs and polyfluorinated compounds (perfluorocarbons - PFCs), nitrogen trifluoride - NF3, sulfuryl fluoride - SO2F2, and sulfur hexafluoride - SF6) and use these measurements to determine the global rates of their emission and/or destruction (i.e., lifetimes); (2) to accurately measure the global distributions and temporal behaviors and determine the sources and sinks of non-CO2 biogenic-anthropogenic gases important to climate change and/or ozone depletion (methane - CH4, nitrous oxide - N2O, carbon monoxide - CO, molecular hydrogen - H2, methyl chloride - CH3Cl, and methyl bromide - CH3Br); (3) to identify new long-lived greenhouse and ozone-depleting gases (e.g., SO2F2, NF3, heavy PFCs (C4F10, C5F12, C6F14, C7F16, and C8F18) and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs; e.g., CH2=CFCF3) have been identified in AGAGE), initiate the real-time monitoring of these new gases, and reconstruct their past histories from AGAGE, air archive, and firn air measurements; (4) to determine the average concentrations and trends of tropospheric hydroxyl radicals (OH) from the rates of destruction of atmospheric trichloroethane (CH3CCl3), HFCs, and HCFCs and estimates of their emissions; (5) to determine from atmospheric observations and estimates of their destruction rates the magnitudes and distributions by region of surface sources and sinks of all measured gases; (6) to provide accurate data on the global accumulation of many of these trace gases that are used to test the synoptic-, regional-, and global-scale circulations predicted by three-dimensional models; and (7) to provide global and regional measurements of methane, carbon monoxide, and molecular hydrogen and estimates of hydroxyl levels to test primary atmospheric oxidation pathways at midlatitudes and the tropics.

Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions from fossil fuels and industry ({\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}FF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change ({\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}LUC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), mainly deforestation, are based on land-cover change data and bookkeeping models. The global atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth ({\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}ATM{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} sink ({\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OCEAN{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) and terrestrial CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} sink ({\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}LAND{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance ({\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}IM{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}/i{\textgreater}.

In addition, we estimate uncertainties in these metrics probabilistically by using a method that does not rely on AOGCMs but instead builds on historical constraints and uncertainty estimates of current radiative forcings. While our mean and median GWPs and GTPs estimates are consistent with previous studies, our analysis suggests that uncertainty ranges for GWPs are almost twice as large as estimated in the AR4. Relative uncertainties for GTPs are larger than for GWPs, nearly twice as high for a time horizon of 100 years. Given this uncertainty, our results imply the possibility for substantial future adjustments in best-estimate values of GWPs and in particular GTPs. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. Climate risks increase with mean global temperature, so knowledge about the amount of future global warming should better inform risk assessments for policymakers. Expected near-term warming is encapsulated by the transient climate response (TCR), formally defined as the warming following 70 years of 1{\%} per year increases in atmospheric CO2concentration, by which point atmospheric CO2has doubled. Studies based on Earth's historical energy budget have typically estimated lower values of TCR than climate models, suggesting that some models could overestimate future warming. However, energy-budget estimates rely on historical temperature records that are geographically incomplete and blend air temperatures over land and sea ice with water temperatures over open oceans. We show that there is no evidence that climate models overestimate TCR when their output is processed in the same way as the HadCRUT4 observation-based temperature record. Models suggest that air-temperature warming is 24{\%} greater than observed by HadCRUT4 over 1861-2009 because slower-warming regions are preferentially sampled and water warms less than air. Correcting for these biases and accounting for wider uncertainties in radiative forcing based on recent evidence, we infer an observation-based best estimate for TCR of 1.66 °C, with a 5-95{\%} range of 1.0-3.3 °C, consistent with the climate models considered in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.},

abstract = {A growth-based Bayesian inverse method is presented for deriving emissions of atmospheric trace species from temporally sparse measurements of their mole fractions. This work is motivated by many recent studies that have deduced emissions using archived air samples with measurement intervals of the order of a year or longer in the early part of the record. Several techniques have been used to make this underdetermined problem invertible. These include the incorporation of prior emissions estimates, the smoothing of observations or derived emissions, the approximation of emissions time series by polynomials, or the application of regularization schemes. However, these methods often suffer from limitations, such as the unavailability of independent, unbiased priors, the emergence of unrealistic emissions fluctuations due to measurement outliers, or the subjective choice of measurement or emissions smoothing time scales. This paper presents an alternative solution that reduces the influence of potentially biased priors or measurement outliers by constraining the emissions growth rate around some growth estimate, in conjunction with the model-measurement mismatch.},

We infer recent SGHG emissions and examine the impact of future emissions scenarios, with a particular focus on proposals to reduce HFC use under the Montreal Protocol. If these proposals are implemented, overall SGHG radiative forcing could peak at around 355 mW m−2 in 2020, before declining by approximately 26{\%} by 2050, despite continued growth of fully fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to “no HFC policy” projections, this amounts to a reduction in radiative forcing of between 50 and 240 mW m−2 by 2050 or a cumulative emissions saving equivalent to 0.5 to 2.8 years of CO2 emissions at current levels. However, more complete reporting of global HFC emissions is required, as less than half of global emissions are currently accounted for.},

Emissions have now fallen to relatively low levels, therefore the rate at which this recovery occurs will depend largely on the atmospheric lifetime of these compounds. The first ODS measurements began in the early 1970s along with the first lifetime estimates calculated by considering their atmospheric trends. We now have global mole fraction records spanning multiple decades, prompting this lifetime re-evaluation. Using surface measurements from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Monitoring Division (NOAA GMD) from 1978 to 2011, we estimated the lifetime of CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113 and CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}CCl{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} using a multi-species inverse method. A steady-state lifetime of 45 yr for CFC-11, currently recommended in the most recent World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) Scientific Assessments of Ozone Depletion, lies towards the lower uncertainty bound of our estimates, which are 54{\textless}sub{\textgreater}48{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}61{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr (1-sigma uncertainty) when AGAGE data were used and 52{\textless}sub{\textgreater}45{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}61{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr when the NOAA network data were used. Our derived lifetime for CFC-113 is significantly higher than the WMO estimates of 85 yr, being 109{\textless}sub{\textgreater}99{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}121{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (AGAGE) and 109{\textless}sub{\textgreater}97{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}124{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (NOAA). New estimates of the steady-state lifetimes of CFC-12 and CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}CCl{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} are consistent with the current WMO recommendations, being 111{\textless}sub{\textgreater}95{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}132{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and 112{\textless}sub{\textgreater}95{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}136{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr (CFC-12, AGAGE and NOAA respectively) and 5.04{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4.92{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}5.20{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and 5.04{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4.87{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}5.23{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr (CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}CCl{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, AGAGE and NOAA respectively).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The growth in global methane (CH4) concentration, which had been ongoing since the industrial revolution, stalled around the year 2000 before resuming globally in 2007. We evaluate the role of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the major CH4 sink, in the recent CH4 growth. We also examine the influence of systematic uncertainties in OH concentrations on CH4 emissions inferred from atmospheric observations. We use observations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (CH3CCl3), which is lost primarily through reaction with OH, to estimate OH levels as well as CH3CC3 emissions, which have uncertainty that previously limited the accuracy of OH estimates. We find a 64–70{\%} probability that a decline in OH has contributed to the post-2007 methane rise. Our median solution suggests that CH4 emissions increased relatively steadily during the late 1990s and early 2000s, after which growth was more modest. This solution obviates the need for a sudden statistically significant change in total CH4 emissions around the year 2007 to explain the atmospheric observations and can explain some of the decline in the atmospheric 13CH4/12CH4 ratio and the recent growth in C2H6. Our approach indicates that significant OH-related uncertainties in the CH4 budget remain, and we find that it is not possible to implicate, with a high degree of confidence, rapid global CH4 emissions changes as the primary driver of recent trends when our inferred OH trends and these uncertainties are considered. },

abstract = {The 2015 Paris Agreement calls for countries to pursue efforts to limit global-mean temperature rise to 1.5 °C. The transition pathways that can meet such a target have not, however, been extensively explored. Here we describe scenarios that limit end-of-century radiative forcing to 1.9 W m−2, and consequently restrict median warming in the year 2100 to below 1.5 °C. We use six integrated assessment models and a simple climate model, under different socio-economic, technological and resource assumptions from five Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Some, but not all, SSPs are amenable to pathways to 1.5 °C. Successful 1.9 W m−2 scenarios are characterized by a rapid shift away from traditional fossil-fuel use towards large-scale low-carbon energy supplies, reduced energy use, and carbon-dioxide removal. However, 1.9 W m−2 scenarios could not be achieved in several models under SSPs with strong inequalities, high baseline fossil-fuel use, or scattered short-term climate policy. Further research can help policy-makers to understand the real-world implications of these scenarios.},

High-frequency records of tropospheric N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O are available from measurements at Cape Grim, Tasmania; Cape Matatula, American Samoa; Ragged Point, Barbados; Mace Head, Ireland; and at Trinidad Head, California using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) instrumentation and calibrations. The Global Monitoring Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) has also collected discrete air samples in flasks and in situ measurements from remote sites across the globe and analyzed them for a suite of species including N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O. In addition to these major networks, we include in situ and aircraft measurements from the National Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES) and flask measurements from the Tohoku University and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) networks. All measurements show increasing atmospheric mole fractions of N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O, with a varying growth rate of 0.1–0.7{\%} per year, resulting in a 7.4{\%} increase in the background atmospheric mole fraction between 1979 and 2011. Using existing emission inventories as well as bottom-up process modeling results, we first create globally gridded a priori N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions over the 37 years since 1975. We then use the three-dimensional chemical transport model, Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers version 4 (MOZART v4), and a Bayesian inverse method to estimate global as well as regional annual emissions for five source sectors from 13 regions in the world. This is the first time that all of these measurements from multiple networks have been combined to determine emissions. Our inversion indicates that global and regional N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions have an increasing trend between 1995 and 2008. Despite large uncertainties, a significant increase is seen from the Asian agricultural sector in recent years, most likely due to an increase in the use of nitrogenous fertilizers, as has been suggested by previous studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Schwarber2019,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Simple climate models (SCMs) are numerical representations of the Earth's gas cycles and climate system. SCMs are easy to use and computationally inexpensive, making them an ideal tool in both scientific and decision-making contexts (e.g., complex climate model emulation, parameter estimation experiments, climate metric calculations, and probabilistic analyses). Despite their prolific use, the fundamental responses of SCMs are often not directly characterized. In this study, we use fundamental impulse tests of three chemical species (CO2, CH4, and black carbon – BC) to understand the fundamental gas cycle and climate system responses of several comprehensive (Hector v2.0, MAGICC 5.3, MAGICC 6.0) and idealized (FAIR v1.0, AR5-IR) SCMs. We find that while idealized SCMs are widely used, they fail to capture the magnitude and timescales of global mean climate responses under emissions perturbations, which can produce biased temperature results. Comprehensive SCMs, which have physically based nonlinear forcing and carbon cycle representations, show improved responses compared to idealized SCMs. Even the comprehensive SCMs, however, fail to capture the response timescales to BC emission perturbations seen recently in two general circulation models. Some comprehensive SCMs also generally respond faster than more complex models to a 4×CO2 concentration perturbation, although this was not evident for lower perturbation levels. These results suggest where improvements should be made to SCMs. Further, we demonstrate here a set of fundamental tests that we recommend as a standard evaluation suite for any SCM. Fundamental impulse tests allow users to understand differences in model responses and the impact of model selection on results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {High frequency, ground-based, in situ measurements from eleven globally-distributed sites covering 1994–2014, combined with measurements of archived air samples dating from 1978 onward and atmospheric transport models, have been used to estimate the growth of 1,1-difluoroethane (HFC-152a, CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}CHF{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) mole fractions in the atmosphere and the global emissions required to derive the observed growth. HFC-152a is a significant greenhouse gas but since it does not contain chlorine or bromine, HFC-152a makes no direct contribution to the destruction of stratospheric ozone and is therefore used as a substitute for the ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). HFC-152a has exhibited substantial atmospheric growth since the first measurements reaching a maximum annualised global growth rate of 0.81 ± 0.05 ppt yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2006, implying a substantial increase in emissions up to 2006. However, since 2007, the annualised rate of growth has slowed to 0.38 ± 0.04 ppt yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2010 with a further decline to an average rate of change in 2013–2014 of {\&}minus;0.06 ± 0.05 ppt yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. The average Northern Hemisphere (NH) mixing ratio in 1994 was 1.2 ppt rising to a mixing ratio of 10.2 ppt in December 2014. Average annual mixing ratios in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in 1994 and 2014 were 0.34 and 4.4 ppt, respectively. We estimate global emissions of HFC-152a have risen from 7.3 ± 5.6 Gg yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 1994 to a maximum of 54.4 ± 17.1 Gg yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2011, declining to 52.5 ± 20.1 Gg yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2014 or 7.2 ± 2.8 Tg-CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} eq yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Analysis of mixing ratio enhancements above regional background atmospheric levels suggests substantial emissions from North America, Asia and Europe. Global HFC emissions (so called "bottom up" emissions) reported by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are based on cumulative national emission data reported to the UNFCCC, which in turn are based on national consumption data. There appears to be a significant underestimate of "bottom-up" global emissions of HFC-152a, possibly arising from largely underestimated USA emissions and undeclared Asian emissions.},

The 2007 adjustment to the Montreal Protocol required the accelerated phase-out of HCFCs with global production and consumption capped in 2013, to mitigate their environmental impact as both ozone depleting substances and important greenhouse gases. We find that this change has coincided with a reduction in global emissions of the four HCFCs with aggregated global emissions in 2015 of 444 ± 75 Gg/yr, in CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} equivalent units (CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} e) 0.75 ± 0.1 Gt/yr, compared with 483 ± 70 Gg/yr (0.82 ± 0.1 Gt/yr CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} e) in 2010. (All quoted uncertainties in this paper are 1 sigma). About 80{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the total HCFC atmospheric burden in 2015 is HCFC-22, where global HCFC emissions appear to have been relatively constant in spite of the 2013 cap on global production and consumption. We attribute this to a probable increase in production and consumption of HCFC-22 in Montreal Protocol Article 5 (developing) countries and the continuing release of HCFC-22 from the large banks which dominate HCFC global emissions. Conversely, the four HFCs all show increasing annual growth rates with aggregated global HFCs emissions in 2015 of 329 ± 70 Gg/yr (0.65 ± 0.12 Gt/yr CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} e) compared to 2010 with 240 ± 50 Gg/yr (0.47 ± 0.08 Gt/yr CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} e). As HCFCs are replaced by HFCs we investigate the impact of the shift to refrigerant blends which have lower global warming potentials (GWPs). We also note that emissions of HFC-125 and HFC-32 appear to have increased more rapidly during the 2011{\&}ndash;2015 5-yr period compared to 2006{\&}ndash;2010.},

The 2009 emissions minimum is consistent with estimates based on national reports and is likely a response to the implementation of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to mitigate HFC-23 emissions by incineration in developing (Non-Annex 1) countries under the Kyoto Protocol. Our derived cumulative emissions of HFC-23 during 2010{\&}ndash;2016 were 89{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;2{\&}thinsp;Gg (1.1{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;0.2{\&}thinsp;Gt{\&}thinsp;CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}-eq), which led to an increase in radiative forcing of 1.0{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;0.1{\&}thinsp;mW{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Although the CDM had reduced global HFC-23 emissions, it cannot now offset the radiative forcing of higher emissions from increasing HCFC-22 production in Non-Annex 1 countries, as the CDM was closed to new entrants in 2009. We also find that the cumulative European HFC-23 emissions from 2010 to 2016 were {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;1.3{\&}thinsp;Gg, corresponding to just 1.5{\&}thinsp;{\%} of cumulative global HFC-23 emissions over this same period.},

abstract = {Simple climate models can be valuable if they are able to replicate aspects of complex fully coupled earth system models. Larger ensembles can be produced, enabling a probabilistic view of future climate change. A simple emissions-based climate model, FAIR, is presented which calculates atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and effective radiative forcing (ERF) from greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone precursors and other agents. The ERFs are integrated into global mean surface temperature change. Model runs are constrained to observed temperature change from 1880 to 2016 and produce a range of future projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. For the historical period the ERF time series in FAIR emulates the results in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), whereas for RCP historical and future scenarios, the greenhouse gas concentrations in FAIR closely track the observations and projections in the RCPs. The constrained estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 2.79 (1.97 to 4.08){\&}thinsp;K, transient climate response (TCR) of 1.47 (1.03 to 2.23){\&}thinsp;K and transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) of 1.43 (1.01 to 2.16){\&}thinsp;K (1000{\&}thinsp;GtC){\&}minus;1 (median and 5{\&}ndash;95{\&}thinsp;{\%} credible intervals) are in good agreement, with tighter uncertainty bounds, than AR5 (1.5 to 4.5{\&}thinsp;K, 1.0 to 2.5{\&}thinsp;K, and 0.8 to 2.5{\&}thinsp;K respectively). The ranges of future projections of temperature and ranges of estimates of ECS, TCR and TCRE are moderately sensitive to the historical temperature dataset used to constrain, prior distributions of ECS/TCR parameters, aerosol radiative forcing relationship and ERF from a doubling of CO2. Taking these sensitivities into account, there is no evidence to suggest that the median and credible range of observationally constrained TCR or ECS differ from climate model-derived estimates. However, the range of temperature projections under the RCP scenarios for 2081{\&}ndash;2100 in the constrained FAIR model ensemble are lower than the emissions-based estimates reported in AR5.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Based on research showing that in the case of a strong aerosol forcing, this forcing establishes itself early in the historical record, a simple model is constructed to explore the implications of a strongly negative aerosol forcing on the early (pre-1950) part of the instrumental record. This model, which contains terms representing both aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions, well represents the known time history of aerosol radiative forcing as well as the effect of the natural state on the strength of aerosol forcing. Model parameters, randomly drawn to represent uncertainty in understanding, demonstrate that a forcing more negative than −1.0 W m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} is implausible, as it implies that none of the approximately 0.3-K temperature rise between 1850 and 1950 can be attributed to Northern Hemisphere forcing. The individual terms of the model are interpreted in light of comprehensive modeling, constraints from observations, and physical understanding to provide further support for the less negative (−1.0 W m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} ) lower bound. These findings suggest that aerosol radiative forcing is less negative and more certain than is commonly believed. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Most importantly, new estimates of N2O emissions from agriculture and from oceans and a surface sink of N2O have been included. Our estimates confirm that current food production is the largest anthropogenic source of N2O. However, its relative share in total anthropogenic emissions (about 60{\%}) is smaller than in earlier studies (almost 80{\%}). We estimate past trends in global emissions of N2O and use these as input to a simple atmospheric box model to calculate trends in atmospheric N2O concentrations for the period 1500–2006. We show that our revised estimates for global emissions of N2O are consistent with observed trends in atmospheric concentrations.},

This is the first multiforcing agent, multimodel evaluation of ERF values calculated using different methods. We demonstrate that previously reported apparent consistency between the ERF values derived from fixed sea surface temperature simulations and linear regression holds for most climate forcings, excluding black carbon (BC). When land adjustment is accounted for, however, the fixed sea surface temperature ERF values are generally 10–30{\%} larger than ERFs derived using linear regression across all forcing agents, with a much larger ({\~{}}70–100{\%}) discrepancy for BC. Except for BC, this difference can be largely reduced by either using radiative kernel techniques or by exponential regression. Responses of clouds and their effects on shortwave radiation show the strongest variability in all experiments, limiting the application of regression-based ERF in small forcing simulations.},

      {\textless}p{\textgreater}Our understanding and quantification of global soil nitrous oxide (N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O) emissions and the underlying processes remain largely uncertain. Here we assessed the effects of multiple anthropogenic and natural factors, including nitrogen fertilizer (N) application, atmospheric N deposition, manure N application, land cover change, climate change and rising atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration, on global soil N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions for the period 1861–2016 using a standard simulation protocol with seven process‐based terrestrial biosphere models. Results suggest global soil N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions have increased from 6.3 ± 1.1 Tg N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O‐N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the pre‐industrial period (the 1860s) to 10.0 ± 2.0 Tg N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O‐N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the recent decade (2007‐2016). Cropland soil emissions increased from 0.3 Tg N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O‐N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 3.3 Tg N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O‐N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} over the same period, accounting for 82{\%} of the total increase. Regionally, China, South Asia and Southeast Asia underwent rapid increases in cropland N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions since the 1970s. However, US cropland N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions had been relatively flat in magnitude since the 1980s, and EU cropland N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions appear to have decreased by 14{\%}. Soil N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions from predominantly natural ecosystems accounted for 67{\%} of the global soil emissions in the recent decade but showed only a relatively small increase of 0.7 ± 0.5 Tg N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O‐N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (11{\%}) since the 1860s. In the recent decade, N fertilizer application, N deposition, manure N application and climate change contributed 54{\%}, 26{\%}, 15{\%} and 24{\%}, respectively, to the total increase. Rising atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration reduced soil N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions by 10{\%} through the enhanced plant N uptake, while land cover change played a minor role. Our estimation here does not account for indirect emissions from soils and the directed emissions from excreta of grazing livestock. To address uncertainties in estimating regional and global soil N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O emissions, this study recommends several critical strategies for improving the process‐based simulations.

abstract = {Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are very potent and long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, released predominantly during aluminium production and semiconductor manufacture. They have been targeted for emission controls under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Here we present the first continuous records of the atmospheric abundance and global emissions of CF4 (PFC-14), C2F6 (PFC-116) and C3F8 (PFC-218) from 1900 to 2014. The records are derived from high precision measurements of PFCs in air extracted from polar firn or ice at six sites (DE08, DE08-2, DSSW20K, EDML, NEEM and South Pole) and air archive tanks and atmospheric air sampled from both hemispheres. We take proper account of the age characteristics of the firn and ice core air samples and demonstrate excellent consistency between the ice core, firn and atmospheric measurements. In addition to an inversion for global emissions from 1900 to 2014, we also formulate the inversion to directly infer emission factors for PFC emissions due to aluminium production prior to the 1980s. We show that the late-Holocene pre-industrial level was 34.05 {\&}pm; 0.33 ppt for CF4, and below detection limits of 0.002 ppt and 0.01 ppt for C2F6 and C3F8, respectively. We find a significant peak in CF4 and C2F6 emissions around 1940, most likely due to the high demand for aluminium during World War II, for example for construction of aircraft. The PFC emission factors for aluminium production in the early twentieth century were significantly higher than today, but have decreased since then due to improvements and better control of the smelting process. We see a temporary reduction of around 15 {\%} in CF4 emissions in 2009, presumably associated with the impact of the Global Financial Crisis on aluminium and semiconductor production.},

abstract = { Atmospheric methane plays a major role in controlling climate, yet contemporary methane trends (1982–2017) have defied explanation with numerous, often conflicting, hypotheses proposed in the literature. Specifically, atmospheric observations of methane from 1982 to 2017 have exhibited periods of both increasing concentrations (from 1982 to 2000 and from 2007 to 2017) and stabilization (from 2000 to 2007). Explanations for the increases and stabilization have invoked changes in tropical wetlands, livestock, fossil fuels, biomass burning, and the methane sink. Contradictions in these hypotheses arise because our current observational network cannot unambiguously link recent methane variations to specific sources. This raises some fundamental questions: ( i ) What do we know about sources, sinks, and underlying processes driving observed trends in atmospheric methane? ( ii ) How will global methane respond to changes in anthropogenic emissions? And ( iii ), What future observations could help resolve changes in the methane budget? To address these questions, we discuss potential drivers of atmospheric methane abundances over the last four decades in light of various observational constraints as well as process-based knowledge. While uncertainties in the methane budget exist, they should not detract from the potential of methane emissions mitigation strategies. We show that net-zero cost emission reductions can lead to a declining atmospheric burden, but can take three decades to stabilize. Moving forward, we make recommendations for observations to better constrain contemporary trends in atmospheric methane and to provide mitigation support. },

In situ measurements are from the global monitoring sites of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE), the System for Observations of Halogenated Greenhouse Gases in Europe (SOGE), and Gosan (South Korea). We include the first halocarbon flask sample measurements from the Antarctic research stations King Sejong and Troll. We also present measurements of archived air samples from both hemispheres back to the 1970s. We use a two-dimensional atmospheric transport model to simulate global atmospheric abundances and to estimate global emissions. HFC-365mfc and HFC-245fa first appeared in the atmosphere only ∼1 decade ago; they have grown rapidly to globally averaged dry air mole fractions of 0.53 ppt (in parts per trillion, 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-12{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and 1.1 ppt, respectively, by the end of 2010. In contrast, HFC-227ea first appeared in the global atmosphere in the 1980s and has since grown to ∼0.58 ppt. We report the first measurements of HFC-236fa in the atmosphere. This long-lived compound was present in the atmosphere at only 0.074 ppt in 2010. All four substances exhibit yearly growth rates of {\textgreater}8{\%} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at the end of 2010. We find rapidly increasing emissions for the foam-blowing compounds HFC-365mfc and HFC-245fa starting in ∼2002. After peaking in 2006 (HFC-365mfc: 3.2 kt yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, HFC-245fa: 6.5 kt yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), emissions began to decline. Our results for these two compounds suggest that recent estimates from long-term projections (to the late 21st century) have strongly overestimated emissions for the early years of the projections (∼2005-2010). Global HFC-227ea and HFC-236fa emissions have grown to average values of 2.4 kt yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and 0.18 kt yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} over the 2008-2010 period, respectively.

abstract = {We report ground-based atmospheric measurements and emission estimates for the halons H-1211 (CBrClF2), H-1301 (CBrF3), and H-2402 (CBrF2CBrF2) fromthe AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration global networks.We also include results from archived air samples in canisters and from polar firn in both hemispheres, thereby deriving an atmospheric record of nearly nine decades (1930s to present). All three halonswere absent from the atmosphere until ∼1970, when their atmospheric burdens started to increase rapidly. In recent years H-1211 and H-2402 mole fractions have been declining, but H-1301 has continued to grow. High-frequency observations show continuing emissions of H-1211 and H-1301 near most AGAGE sites. For H-2402 the only emissions detected were derived from the region surrounding the Sea of Japan/East Sea. Based on our observations, we derive global emissions using two different inversion approaches. Emissions for H-1211 declined from a peak of 11 kt yr−1 (late 1990s) to 3.9 kt yr−1 at the end of our record (mean of 2013–2015), for H-1301 from5.4 kt yr−1 (late 1980s) to 1.6 kt yr−1, and for H-2402 from1.8 kt yr−1 (late 1980s) to 0.38 kt yr−1. Yearly summed halon emissions have decreased substantially; nevertheless, since 2000 they have accounted for ∼30{\%} of the emissions of all major anthropogenic ozone depletion substances, when weighted by ozone depletion potentials. {\textcopyright}2016.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Author(s) 2018. Based on observations of the chlorofluorocarbons CFC-13 (chlorotrifluoromethane), {\pounds}CFC-114 (combined measurement of both isomers of dichlorotetrafluoroethane), and CFC-115 (chloropentafluoroethane) in atmospheric and firn samples, we reconstruct records of their tropospheric histories spanning nearly 8 decades. These compounds were measured in polar firn air samples, in ambient air archived in canisters, and in situ at the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) network and affiliated sites. Global emissions to the atmosphere are derived from these observations using an inversion based on a 12-box atmospheric transport model. For CFC-13, we provide the first comprehensive global analysis. This compound increased monotonically from its first appearance in the atmosphere in the late 1950s to a mean global abundance of 3.18ppt (dry-air mole fraction in parts per trillion, pmol mol'1) in 2016. Its growth rate has decreased since the mid-1980s but has remained at a surprisingly high mean level of 0.02ppt yr'1 since 2000, resulting in a continuing growth of CFC-13 in the atmosphere. {\pounds}CFC-114 increased from its appearance in the 1950s to a maximum of 16.6ppt in the early 2000s and has since slightly declined to 16.3ppt in 2016. CFC-115 increased monotonically from its first appearance in the 1960s and reached a global mean mole fraction of 8.49ppt in 2016. Growth rates of all three compounds over the past years are significantly larger than would be expected from zero emissions. Under the assumption of unchanging lifetimes and atmospheric transport patterns, we derive global emissions from our measurements, which have remained unexpectedly high in recent years: mean yearly emissions for the last decade (2007-2016) of CFC-13 are at 0.48 ± 0.15kt yr'1 ({\textgreater} 15{\%} of past peak emissions), of {\pounds}CFC-114 at 1.90 ± 0.84kt yr'1 (1/4 10{\%} of peak emissions), and of CFC-115 at 0.80 ± 0.50kt yr'1 ({\textgreater} 5{\%} of peak emissions). Mean yearly emissions of CFC-115 for 2015-2016 are 1.14 ± 0.50kt yr'1 and have doubled compared to the 2007-2010 minimum. We find CFC-13 emissions from aluminum smelters but if extrapolated to global emissions, they cannot account for the lingering global emissions determined from the atmospheric observations. We find impurities of CFC-115 in the refrigerant HFC-125 (CHF2CF3) but if extrapolated to global emissions, they can neither account for the lingering global CFC-115 emissions determined from the atmospheric observations nor for their recent increases. We also conduct regional inversions for the years 2012-2016 for the northeastern Asian area using observations from the Korean AGAGE site at Gosan and find significant emissions for {\pounds}CFC-114 and CFC-115, suggesting that a large fraction of their global emissions currently occur in northeastern Asia and more specifically on the Chinese mainland.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Results from simulations performed for the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Modeling Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) are analysed to examine how OH and methane lifetime may change from present day to the future, under different climate and emissions scenarios. Present day (2000) mean tropospheric chemical lifetime derived from the ACCMIP multi-model mean is 9.8 ± 1.6 yr (9.3 ± 0.9 yr when only including selected models), lower than a recent observationally-based estimate, but with a similar range to previous multi-model estimates. Future model projections are based on the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and the results also exhibit a large range. Decreases in global methane lifetime of 4.5 ± 9.1{\%} are simulated for the scenario with lowest radiative forcing by 2100 (RCP 2.6), while increases of 8.5 ± 10.4{\%} are simulated for the scenario with highest radiative forcing (RCP 8.5). In this scenario, the key driver of the evolution of OH and methane lifetime is methane itself, since its concentration more than doubles by 2100 and it consumes much of the OH that exists in the troposphere. Stratospheric ozone recovery, which drives tropospheric OH decreases through photolysis modifications, also plays a partial role. In the other scenarios, where methane changes are less drastic, the interplay between various competing drivers leads to smaller and more diverse OH and methane lifetime responses, which are difficult to attribute. For all scenarios, regional OH changes are even more variable, with the most robust feature being the large decreases over the remote oceans in RCP8.5. Through a regression analysis, we suggest that differences in emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds and in the simulation of photolysis rates may be the main factors causing the differences in simulated present day OH and methane lifetime. Diversity in predicted changes between present day and future OH was found to be associated more strongly with differences in modelled temperature and stratospheric ozone changes. Finally, through perturbation experiments we calculated an OH feedback factor ({\textless}i{\textgreater}F{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) of 1.24 from present day conditions (1.50 from 2100 RCP8.5 conditions) and a climate feedback on methane lifetime of 0.33 ± 0.13 yr K{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, on average. Models that did not include interactive stratospheric ozone effects on photolysis showed a stronger sensitivity to climate, as they did not account for negative effects of climate-driven stratospheric ozone recovery on tropospheric OH, which would have partly offset the overall OH/methane lifetime response to climate change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A critical issue in climate change economics is the specifica- tion of the so-called “damages function” and its interaction with the unknown uncertainty of catastrophic outcomes. This paper asks how much we might be misled by our eco- nomic assessment of climate change when we employ a conventional quadratic damages function and/or a thin-tailed probability distribution for extreme temperatures. The paper gives some numerical examples of the indirect value of various greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration targets as insurance against catastrophic climate change temperatures and damages. These numerical exercises suggest that we might be underestimating considerably the welfare losses from uncertainty by using a quadratic damages function and/or a thin-tailed temperature distribution. In these examples, the primary reason for keeping GHG levels down is to insure against high-temperature catastrophic climate risks.},

Res. Lett. 10 031001 Abstract In a recent letter, Ricke and Caldeira (2014 Environ. Res. Lett. 9 124002) estimated that the timing between an emission and the maximum temperature response is a decade on average. In their analysis, they took into account uncertainties about the carbon cycle, the rate of ocean heat uptake and the climate sensitivity but did not consider one important uncertainty: the size of the emission. Using simulations with an Earth System Model we show that the time lag between a carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission pulse and the maximum warming increases for larger pulses. Our results suggest that as CO 2 accumulates in the atmosphere, the full warming effect of an emission may not be felt for several decades, if not centuries. Most of the warming, however, will emerge relatively quickly, implying that CO 2 emission cuts will not only benefit subsequent generations but also the generation implementing those cuts.},
